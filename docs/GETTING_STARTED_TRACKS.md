# Getting Started Tracks

Choose the track that matches your immediate goal.

- [Quickstart Track](GETTING_STARTED_QUICKSTART.md): fastest path from clone to running `boomhauer` app.
- [API-First Track](GETTING_STARTED_API_FIRST.md): JSON API setup, schema/auth contracts, and OpenAPI docs.
- [HTML-First Track](GETTING_STARTED_HTML_FIRST.md): server-rendered EOC templates, layouts, forms, and validation rendering.
- [Data-Layer Track](GETTING_STARTED_DATA_LAYER.md): SQL builder + PostgreSQL + migrations + standalone `ArlenData` usage.

If you are unsure, start with the quickstart track and then continue to API-first or HTML-first.
